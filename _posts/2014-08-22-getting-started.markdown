title: Getting started
summary: Just get going

Setting up a blog has been in my priority list for quite some time now.
However I had been delaying it for a long time now. With no apparent reason
whatsoever, except the fact that I was searching for the "perfect setup".
Finally, after some inspiration from my roommate [Vivek](https://vivekiitkgp.github.io), I realised 
that it would do me no good, unless I got my hands dirty. And, here I am 
writing my first blog post.

Presently I am using Nikola [1], and deploying the webpage on Github Pages. 
It is easy to get started, as Nikola takes care of most of the things for you, 
and is pretty well documented as well. If you would like to get started, the 
source code for this site is available on Github [2] . Only one piece of advice, 
don't give up half way through. Push a little bit more, look up the source of 
other existing blogs, spend some more time. The experience will be fun. The site 
is pretty basic currently, however I wish to spend some more time on it. So, 
there might be frequent modifications, before I fixate on something more stable.
