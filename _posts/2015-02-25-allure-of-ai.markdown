Jim stared with intent. This was way more interesting than the stupid cartoons Tim watched.
Tiny ants busily carrying scrapes of porridge that had *fallen* on the carpet.
They must be so much more intelligent than his classmates, he thought. 
Following each other seamlessly, coordinating and sharing their load when required. 
A casual  bump here and there. Otherwise, moving as if tuned to perfection.
Easily finding a way around, even when he obstructed their path with his hand. 
His classmates wouldn't even form a queue, without Mrs. Smith shouting.
"I wish I were an ant", he sighed, enjoying his new-found hobby.


We know better than Jim however, don't we? That ants take random wandering paths in search 
of food, and use chemical trails (yes, pheromones) to mark the shortest and easiest route.
There's obviously not much *thinking* involved here. Or is there? And if ants do think, 
does it make them *intelligent*? What is intelligence? How closely is the ability to
rationalize and think associated with intelligence? Myriad such questions crawl out 
from the woodwork of Jim's curiosity for ants.

And Jim isn't alone. The innate ability of living organisms, specially humans,
to perform complex and sophisticated tasks 
with apparent ease, has intrigued researchers since the early days of mathematical thinking.
From Plato to Turing, many crusaders of science have been fascinated by the abstractions of
intelligence and consciousness. And it was this fascination that gave birth to the idea of 
**Artificial Intelligence**. Replicating the ability to take decisions, learning and interacting with
the surrounding in an efficient manner, to say the least.

The rising interest in AI has been phenomenal. Expert systems, like chess-playing computer
programs which now assist players in their training, have been around for quite sometime.
However, other forms of *Weak AI* have started entering different aspects of human-life at 
a larger scale; be it in the form of Siri - the personal assistant, or the Google self-driving car.
So much so, that pioneers in modern day scientific community, like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, 
have opined about the potential dangers of AI. On the face of it, this might look a bit far-fetched,
already cautioning against something which haven't yet achieved. Well, same was the case with Internet.

I, for one, believe that the journey to develop AI is going to be much more exciting than AI itself.
The argument for this is two-fold. To begin with, this would provide some closure to the 
classical standoff regarding the *seat* of intelligence and consciousness. Is it possible to 
encapsulate intelligence as a purely computational model of thought? Or is there 
a more fundamental physical basis which cannot be captured, by our present grasp of how things work?
On the other hand, this would help realize the limitations of *intelligence* as a whole. That is,
does there exist any possibility for machines, superhuman as they may be, to demystify all the secrets of the universe?
Or is this the Holy Grail, well beyond the grasp of anything we can possibly imagine?

*Such, is the allure of AI.*
