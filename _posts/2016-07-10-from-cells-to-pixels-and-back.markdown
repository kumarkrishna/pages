>"The summer vision project is an attempt to use our summer workers effectively in the construction of a significant part of a visual system. The particular task was chosen partly because it can be segmented into sub-problems which will allow individuals to work independently and yet participate in the construction of a system complex enough to be a real landmark in the development of _pattern recognition_ "

Above, is the abstract from the memo for the [Summer Vision Project](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6125), initiated on July 7, 1966 under the vision of [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky) at the then, Artificial Intelligence Group, MIT. The problem at hand, to  _"spend the summer linking a camera to a computer and getting the computer to describe what it saw"_ [\[1\]](http://szeliski.org/Book/). It's been 50 years, and we're just getting warmed up.

Drafted by [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert), the project was one of the first initiatives into what has grown into the field of Computer Vision. With then undergraduate students [Gerald Jay Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman), [Bill Gosper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gosper), [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport), [Richard Greenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Greenblatt) and several others, the project helped realise the immense complexity in understanding and replicating visual systems. While the required time for **_solving the problem_** was grossly underestimated, we have indeed come a long way.

Studying the human visual system, medically and in the spirit of curiosity, dates back to historic figures like Euclid and Ptolemy. And with advances in computer science, the interest in artificial perception systems gained popularity. Ubiquitous in the image processing and video encoding literature, _picture elements_, or **_pixels_** became the foundational approach to realizing this. And with Barlow's seminal paper on the [**Efficient encoding hypothesis**](http://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262518420.001.0001/upso-9780262518420-chapter-13) in 1961, there was a huge impetus to statistical approaches in Computer Vision.

Starting with pixels, onto feature learning and dealing with complex tasks like object detection, scene understanding became the subject of research in the field. Pixel-wise operations, however were nowhere close to interpreting the visual world. From there on, we've seen the introduction of representation learning algorithms like [SIFT](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/) which made object comparisons across images viable. And with support from machine learning theory, including [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine), we had scalable image classifiers.

The journey of the research in the field, with the advancements in Artificial Neural Networks is a story in itself. Previously improbable tasks like [image captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555), [visual question answering](http://visualqa.org) and [generating natural images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), now look optimistically plausible. With [insights](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04156v2.pdf) from the rapidly developing fields of Neuroscience and Machine Learning, summer might just be round the corner.

What better time to explore and revisit some such interesting topics which shape the field of present Artificial and Human vision research? After all
