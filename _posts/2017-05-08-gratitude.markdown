Seldom in life, there are choices which end up defining you as a person. Probably from joining this institute to switching majors to Math as a sophomore, were mine. And it was largely because of the amazing people that I have come across in this exhilarating journey of five years. Gracious mentors, wonderful seniors, crazy friends and loving juniors.

There will be innumerable times when you'll have to choose between the easy and the right alternative. With each passing moment I am only thankful of my past-self for trying to be bold and avoiding the easy. To juniors; discover your interests, talk to people, nudge outside your comfort zone, and hopefully while at it you'll stumble upon your reason to love KGP. I did :) .
